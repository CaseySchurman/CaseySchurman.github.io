				<h2>Hi, and welcome to my online project portfolio! My name is Casey Schurman, and below 
				you will see a list of different projects I've worked on. Click the links at the
				top-right to see the different categories of projects. Also, if you click a project
				"square", it will advance you to the project outside of this website (If the project doesn't
				have a link or isn't finished, only a picture will be displayed). I'm currently 
				an intern at Jeld-Wen, as well as finishing my last year at Oregon Institute of 
				Technology, getting my Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. At the bottom of 
				the page I have my email address if you wish to contact me. Thank you!
